## 🎨 Design Features

- **School-themed UI**: Light blue, white, and pastel gradients
- **Card-based Layout**: Clean, modern card design with rounded corners
- **Responsive Design**: Works on both desktop and mobile devices
- **Gamified Elements**: Coin icons and progress indicators

## 📝 Mock Data

The application uses mock data stored in `src/data/mockData.js` that simulates a Google Sheets database. This includes:
- Student records with coin balances
- Available tasks with rewards
- Redemption options

## 🔄 Google Sheets Integration

Currently, the app uses localStorage to persist data. To integrate with Google Sheets API:

1. Set up Google Sheets API credentials
2. Replace localStorage operations in `AppContext.js` with API calls
3. Update the authentication logic in the `login` function
4. Modify data update functions to sync with Google Sheets

## 🎯 Future Enhancements

- Real-time notifications for new tasks
- Email/SMS notifications for redemptions
- Advanced analytics and reporting
- Mobile app version
- Integration with school management systems
- Multi-language support
